#### A Jupyter notebook
#### By **Sharon Faith**
## Description
The notebook contains the analysis on a project whose main objective was to build a model that determines whether or not a patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroidism, using information from [this dataset](http://bit.ly/hypothyroid_data). Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis and modelling (random forests, gradient boosting, support vector machines) were carried out to aid in achieving the objective.
